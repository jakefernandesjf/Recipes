    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1/2 rack</em> of any style pork ribs</li>
        <li><em>2 cups</em> of barbecue sauce</li>
        <li><em>2 tablespoons</em> of meat seasoning</li>
        <li><em>2 tablespoons</em> of freshly ground pepper</li>

        <li>Remove fat membranes from ribs with the help of a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Pat dry the ribs.</li>
        <li>Generously season both sides of meat with ground pepper and meat seasoning. Rub into both sides.</li>
